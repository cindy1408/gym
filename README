Users who don't know what they want: 
If the user is new to the gym, the app will be able to recommend a workout depending on the users lifestyle.. such as number of workout days they are able to commit to and the area of the body they want to focus (cardio vs weight lifting), the app can also recommend the appropriate amount of set and reps for the users and adjust accordingly. 
The app will also automatically increase the rep or set by 1 if the last updated exercise was more than 24 hours ago. 

Both will consists of: 
App will automatically increase the rep or set by 1 if completed by user.
