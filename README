model/model_gen.go: 
this is file with structs generated by gqlgen, defined by the schema file schema.graphqls

generated/generated.go: 
this is a file with generated code that injects context and middleware for each query and mutation.

schema.graphqls: 
a GraphQL schema file where types, queries, and mutations are defined. The schema file uses schema-definition-language (SDL) to describe data types and operations (queries/mutations) in a human-readable way.

schema.resolvers.go: 
a go file with wrapper code for queries and mutations defined in schema.graphqls


if the schema changes, we need to regenerate the code using:
path: /graphql  
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
go run server.go


GORM: 

go get -u gorm.io/gorm
go get -u gorm.io/driver/postgres



NEXT STEP: 

look into postgres packages and using the DB from resolver





// container is called gym, user is postgres with password as password
docker run --name gym -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

// to  pre-populated database we need a docker file and docker image 

// creates the image and tells Docker to build an image from the Dockerfile and give it a name of 'gym-db'
docker build -t gym-db ./

// to view docker image 

docker images -a

// to run the container 
docker run -d --name gym -p 5432:5432 gym-db

// to restart container 

docker restart gym
