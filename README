Create User 
Using user id, create workout_cycle 
insert workout cycle back into user 
create workout_day using workout cycle id 
create exercise using workout day id and then insert exercise id back into workout_day




model/model_gen.go: 
this is file with structs generated by gqlgen, defined by the schema file schema.graphqls

generated/generated.go: 
this is a file with generated code that injects context and middleware for each query and mutation.

schema.graphqls: 
a GraphQL schema file where types, queries, and mutations are defined. The schema file uses schema-definition-language (SDL) to describe data types and operations (queries/mutations) in a human-readable way.

schema.resolvers.go: 
a go file with wrapper code for queries and mutations defined in schema.graphqls


if the schema changes, we need to regenerate the code using:
path: /graphql  
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
go run server.go



Database 

using postgres through docker 

visit https://hub.docker.com/ and find the images needed (this case it was postgres)

in the terminal: 

(to login to your account)
$docker login 



in this case: 
docker run --name gym -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres

to stop postgres 
$docker stop gym

checks what's running 
docker ps 

need to remove the container and then run it again. 
docker rm gym

GORM: 

go get -u gorm.io/gorm
go get -u gorm.io/driver/postgres



NEXT STEP: 

Hydrating directly to the database - DONE

Create User - DONE 

Read https://thenewstack.io/understanding-golang-packages/

Get all User - done

Get User Id by Email && check if email is valid - done 

connect user id with exercise name, reps and sets (AddUserWorkout) - done 

To be able to update baseExercise - done 

to match the schema with the ERD diagram (tables)

Look into docker compose up and docker compose down
